# 🏥 Medinet — Dispensary Management System

**Medinet** is a web-based Dispensary Management System designed to streamline healthcare services across multiple dispensaries. It enables real-time doctor booking, efficient patient management, and smooth pharmacy operations — all in one platform.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Patients can register, book available doctors, and track the current patient number in real-time. This allows them to estimate waiting times and arrive just in time — reducing crowding and delays.

Doctors manage appointments and issue digital prescriptions, which are instantly sent to the pharmacy. Pharmacists can then dispense medicine without waiting for printed slips. 

Admins oversee all user roles and manage dispensary details efficiently.

By integrating real-time tracking and seamless doctor–patient–pharmacy interaction, Medinet enhances healthcare efficiency and patient satisfaction.
